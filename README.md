## My BIO
  Hi! My name is Julia. At one time, I graduated as a manager, worked in the banking sector and built a career there. I resigned from the position of head of the department, because I finally realized that I really want to develop my hobby, since I rest my soul while programming 😊
  Since I was a teenager, I've been building PCs, creating websites in HTML, then on Tilda. I received a diploma of professional retraining "1C Developer", I also have a diploma of professional retraining "Developer of mobile games on Unity", a certificate of completion of courses on working with databases in SQL. I am currently studying at Urban University with a degree in Python Developer. 😇
  I am also a happy mother of two small children (son and daughter) on parental leave.😁
